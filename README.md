# Minecraft on replit (online)

I seen this on Replit and decided to paste in the Replit URL for anyone who (somehow) don't know about it yet.

At some point I might make a fullscreen version of it (and it won't just be [this](https://replit.com/@pxlmastr/Minecraft-Official-V20?lite=1&outputonly=1))

Good Bye!

**PS**: You can't play the actual Minecraft Java game without either a Mojang-for-Minecraft account (which costs money) or a Microsoft-migrated-from-Mojang-for-Minecraft account (which also costs money) (I hope that last part wasn't too confusing *lol*)

**PPS**: The game might be slightly laggy and/or slow on some webbrowsers.
